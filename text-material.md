            ​

        <h1>WHAT IS AN LDA?</h1>
        <p>
            Legal Document Assistants (LDAs) and Unlawful Detainer Assistants (UDAs) are experienced professionals authorized by California law and the county in which they operate to assist the public in preparing legal documents.

            ​

            An individual must be a registered LDA or UDA to assist others with the preparation of legal documents. State law requires LDAs and UDAs to be registered and bonded in the county where they operate. LDAs and UDAs must meet educational and/or professional requirements to become registered.

            ​

            Searching for self-help information online can yield helpful, yet incomplete or contradictory information. As an LDA, MLDS can provide you with attorney prepared, reviewed, and approved legal information allowing you to decide how to proceed with your legal matter.

            ​

            MLDS can also prepare the legal documents you want completed in a professional and efficient manner, from wills and trusts to evictions.

            Paralegals must be employed by a law firm or an attorney. Paralegals are not permitted to provide document assistance, court assistance, or document preparation to individuals. (CA Business & Professions Code § 6450.)



            The required bonds carried by LDAs and UDAs provide peace of mind to their clients.
